🚲 Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Ford GoBike (Bay Wheels) trip dataset to uncover differences in riding behavior between Subscribers (regular commuters) and Customers (casual riders). Both exploratory and explanatory analyses were completed to understand usage patterns, trip characteristics, and how user type influences behavior.

🔍 Key Insights

Subscribers

Ride mainly for commuting purposes

Short trips (typically < 20 minutes)

Heavy usage during weekday rush hours

Customers

Longer recreational trips

Higher usage on weekends and midday hours

➡ Trip duration emerged as the strongest indicator of rider type.
